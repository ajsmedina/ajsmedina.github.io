				<h3>Box</h3>
				
				<p>PokeBOX (codenamed BOX) is a project that was used to learn and explore PHP and MySQL while creating something functionally useful.</p>
				
				<p> <a href="http://ajsmedina.altervista.org/login.php"> [PokeBOX]</a> <a href="https://github.com/ajsmedina/PokeBOX"> [GitHub]</a></p>
				
				<p>Users can login using their trainer name to access their box, and then add Pokemon, remove Pokemon, or modify the Pokemon in their box. Then the user can
				create a team which gets analyzed for strengths and weaknesses.</p>

				<h3> PokeAPI </h3>
				<p>PokeAPI is an API that contains all the data from the Pokemon games in an easily-retrievable format.</p>
				<p>PokeBOX uses PokeAPI to gather relevant data to be used in analyzing the teams, such as Pokemon stats, move types, and type matchups.</p>
				<p>PHP code is run that retrieves the data from PokeAPI and stores it in a database using MySQL, allowing it to be used later on.</p>

				<h3> Unity and C# </h3>
				<p>This project was developed in the game engine Unity. Unity's physics engine and assets system allows for a simplified workflow that lets me focus on developing the game.</p>
				<p>The code for Alien Entrepreneurs in the Wild Wild West is written in C# and implements many of Unity's build-in libraries to create functionality for the game.</p>

				<h3> The Full Package </h3>
				<p>Because this is a one-man project, everything is created by me. I programmed the game functionality, designed the levels, and drew the graphics for the game.</p>
				<p>There are many parts that are still placeholders (such as the actual alien designs) since this game is still in development. However, 6 levels are currently playable for some
				fun team-building adventures.</p>
