				<h3>Lifeline</h3>
				
				<p>Alien Entrepreneurs in the Wild Wild West (codenamed LIFELINE) is my first serious attempt at making a complete game in Unity.</p>
				
				<p> <a href="https://github.com/ajsmedina/Alien-Entrepreneurs"> [GitHub]</a></p>
				
				<p>The premise of the game is that four aliens crash-land in the Wild Wild West and their spaceship breaks! Except for the machine that turns
				vegetables into hats. So the aliens must work together to collect vegetables, turn them into hats, sell the hats, and buy parts to rebuild their spaceship.</p>
				
				
				<p>By working together in this four-player co-operative puzzle-platforming game, players can help the aliens get back home!</p>

				<h3> Why Co-Op? </h3>
				<p>One of my favourite things to do is working in a team to accomplish goals. That is why "couch co-op" games (co-operative games played together on one system) are some of my 
				favourite games.</p>
				<p>Inspire by Overcooked and Death Squared, Alien Entrepreneurs in the Wild Wild West requires people to work together and communicate in order to complete their goals. And
				they can do so wearing cool hats!</p>

				<h3> Unity and C# </h3>
				<p>This project was developed in the game engine Unity. Unity's physics engine and assets system allows for a simplified workflow that lets me focus on developing the game.</p>
				<p>The code for Alien Entrepreneurs in the Wild Wild West is written in C# and implements many of Unity's build-in libraries to create functionality for the game.</p>

				<h3> The Full Package </h3>
				<p>Because this is a one-man project, everything is created by me. I programmed the game functionality, designed the levels, and drew the graphics for the game.</p>
				<p>There are many parts that are still placeholders (such as the actual alien designs) since this game is still in development. However, 6 levels are currently playable for some
				fun team-building adventures.</p>
