			<p>Project: LIFELINE</p>

			<p>First blog post! This one is about my game, Alien Entrepreneurs from the Wild Wild West. 
			This is a co-op puzzle game in which players control 4 aliens who have recently crash-landed in the Wild West. 
			They must work together to collect eggplants and turn them into hats which they can sell to pay for their ship to be rebuilt.</p>

			
			<p>Players must work together and avoid obstacles to reach the eggplant in each level. This picture showcases the game with basic art added during the past few days. 
			Over the next few days, I will show off different features to the game and levels, as well as outline the development process, the difficulties I run into, 
			and the solutions I put together.</p>
