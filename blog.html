				<h3> Jan 11 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: NPC</p>

				<p>Last night, a friend helped me come up with an idea for a simple webapp that would allow to me to learn javascript. I want to learn javascript
				in order to provide more functionality to expand on my website and for chrome extensions.</p>

				
				<p>This project is relatively simple. It generates a random non-player character that can be used for a Dungeons and Dragons game. I plan to add
				saving/exporting functionality once the rest of it settles in.</p>

				<h3> Jan 10 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: KITCHEN</p>

				<p>Today, I wanted to share about another project of mine. This one is called "CookIt", a game made for my High School Computer Engineering class.</p>

				<p>This is an endless game where two players have to endlessly cook burgers by working together. Each player has access to a certain set of tools
				and must pass along ingredients for the other to use.</p>
				
				<p>This project was made in Python using the Pygame module. It was developed to be played on a Raspberry Pi using the EveOne board. I'll be blogging about
				this interfacing on a later date!</p>

				<h3> Jan 09 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: TOWER</p>

				<p>Today's blog is about my project, Endless Tower. This is a randomly-generated text-based roleplaying game made using Java. I had a lot of fun with this project.
				While it was created for the purpose of a project in a High School Computer Science class, I was fascinated by the idea of making my own
				randomly-generated RPG and went above the scope of the project.</p>

				
				<p>Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to give it the proper balance testing and enemy/item variety that I had hoped for. I plan to increase
				that variety soon, giving the players a constantly changing experience.</p>

				<h3> Jan 08 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: SPIDER</p>

				<p>I wanted to blog today about this website. I learned a little bit of HTML and CSS in a high school web design class, but didn't expect to actually
				put those skills to use. I wanted to design my own website as a type of challenge for myself. I wanted to see how much I remembered, but also how much
				I could do now. It was fun putting pieces together and recalling certain design aspects and techniques I learned previously.</p>

				
				<p>I wanted to give my website a minimalistic look. I feel that overcrowding and excess design tends to bog down websites and I wanted to avoid that so that
				my website was easy to navigate and placed its focus on the content. This is what it looks like at the time of writing, but I want to learn more and do more
				and see what else I can make out of it.</p>
				
				<p>Lastly, I wanted to blog about the codenames. Mostly, I don't want to have to rewrite "Alien Entrepreneurs from the Wild Wild West" or "Inspirational New
				Tab Page" on every single blog post, so I thought it would be fun to give these projects names. The website gets the name "SPIDER" because of the keyword "web".
				Puns are lots of fun!</p>

				<h3> Jan 07 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: INSPIRE</p>

				<p>Today I'm showcasing my newest learning experience in developing an extension for Google Chrome, an endeavor I always wanted to do.
				I decided to start it off simple with a New Tab Page to replace the default page that I never use. This replacement will display an inspiring quote
				to the user.</p>

				
				<p>I was a little shocked and excited to find out that it's pretty much just simple HTML to create this page. What's interesting is how to move forward. 
				I want to integrate the twitter API into this extension in order to randomly pull up inspiring tweets. Being unfamiliar with the twitter API, this seems
				quite daunting, but I'm also excited to learn from this!</p>
