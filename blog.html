				<h3> Jan 13 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: LEGO</p>

				<p>Throughout my later years of high school, I joined my school's robotics team. We were a team of three guys who had an interest in computers and took the school's
				computer engineering course. As a team of three, we were tasked with designing, building, programming, and testing robots to compete in various competions, as well
				as help run other competitions for elementary schools.</p>
				
				<p>We used python to get these robots moving, and through rigorous testing we continued to improve our robots. We competed in UOIT's Sumobot competition in both years.
				We were new to the concept in 2015 and only did decently, but in 2016 we used what we learned and made an even better robot. We were close to making the semifinals, and while
				we didn't win, we learned a lot and had lots of fun with it!</p>

				<h3> Jan 11 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: NPC</p>

				<p>Last night, a friend helped me come up with an idea for a simple webapp that would allow to me to learn javascript. I want to learn javascript
				in order to provide more functionality to expand on my website and for chrome extensions.</p>

				
				<p>This project is relatively simple. It generates a random non-player character that can be used for a Dungeons and Dragons game. I plan to add
				saving/exporting functionality once the rest of it settles in.</p>

				<h3> Jan 10 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: KITCHEN</p>

				<p>Today, I wanted to share about another project of mine. This one is called "CookIt", a game made for my High School Computer Engineering class.</p>

				<p>This is an endless game where two players have to endlessly cook burgers by working together. Each player has access to a certain set of tools
				and must pass along ingredients for the other to use.</p>
				
				<p>This project was made in Python using the Pygame module. It was developed to be played on a Raspberry Pi using the EveOne board. I'll be blogging about
				this interfacing on a later date!</p>

				<h3> Jan 09 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: TOWER</p>

				<p>Today's blog is about my project, Endless Tower. This is a randomly-generated text-based roleplaying game made using Java. I had a lot of fun with this project.
				While it was created for the purpose of a project in a High School Computer Science class, I was fascinated by the idea of making my own
				randomly-generated RPG and went above the scope of the project.</p>

				
				<p>Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to give it the proper balance testing and enemy/item variety that I had hoped for. I plan to increase
				that variety soon, giving the players a constantly changing experience.</p>

				<h3> Jan 08 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: SPIDER</p>

				<p>I wanted to blog today about this website. I learned a little bit of HTML and CSS in a high school web design class, but didn't expect to actually
				put those skills to use. I wanted to design my own website as a type of challenge for myself. I wanted to see how much I remembered, but also how much
				I could do now. It was fun putting pieces together and recalling certain design aspects and techniques I learned previously.</p>

				
				<p>I wanted to give my website a minimalistic look. I feel that overcrowding and excess design tends to bog down websites and I wanted to avoid that so that
				my website was easy to navigate and placed its focus on the content. This is what it looks like at the time of writing, but I want to learn more and do more
				and see what else I can make out of it.</p>
				
				<p>Lastly, I wanted to blog about the codenames. Mostly, I don't want to have to rewrite "Alien Entrepreneurs from the Wild Wild West" or "Inspirational New
				Tab Page" on every single blog post, so I thought it would be fun to give these projects names. The website gets the name "SPIDER" because of the keyword "web".
				Puns are lots of fun!</p>
