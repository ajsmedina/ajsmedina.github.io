				<h3> May 05 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: BOX</p>

				<p>Last term got pretty busy so I didn't get too much time to update the blog, but I'm back!</p>
				
				<p>While there have been a few updates on other projects, I mostly wanted to talk about my newest project: PokeBOX!</p>
				<p>PokeBOX uses PHP and MySQL to make an interactive web environment. This is my first time trying this out, so it took a while to learn, but the site has
				its basic functionality down!</p>
				<p>I need to refine the look and flow of it, but I'm happy that I was able to overcome this challenge!</p>

				<h3> Jan 22 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: LIFELINE</p>

				<p>I've been having a lot of fun working on LIFELINE recently so I wanted to write a little bit about level design.</p>
				<p>Whenever approaching a level, I try to think of the difficulty - easy, medium, or hard. I want a strong variety so players can work their way up and feel rewarded as they gain more
				hats and beat harder challenges</p>
				<p>I usually start with one part of the level that I like and then work on making it so every player is involved. For this level, I started with a falling stack of cows and a moving basket.
				This was the first level in which I implemented a platform that two characters interact with at the same time. One player moves the basket, one triggers the door aspect of it.<p>
				<p>By working together, players can overcome the gimmicks and get their vegetables! This level was lots of fun to design, but it did end up more difficult than I expected so I plan on making
				an easy level soon</p>

				<h3> Jan 21 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: LIFELINE</p>

				<p>LIFELINE is going well! I was able to add customizable hats and a HUB to the game.</p>
				
				<p>Because the aliens plan on being entrepreneurs and selling hats, players get to wear the hats they make. They can adventure around the HUB world
				to change hats and choose levels, then work together to complete puzzles in each level. I'm working to add a variety of hats and puzzles to make a fun and funny co-op experience!</p>
				
				<p>Currently the only hats are top hat, santa hat, and pylon. I currently plan on adding pirate hats, a literal bucket, a halo, cat ears, and more! I hope players will have fun
				collecting hats and dressing up their aliens.</p>
