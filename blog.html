				<h3> Jan 08 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: SPIDER</p>

				<p>I wanted to blog today about this website. I learned a little bit of HTML and CSS in a high school web design class, but didn't expect to actually
				put those skills to use. I wanted to design my own website as a type of challenge for myself. I wanted to see how much I remembered, but also how much
				I could do now. It was fun putting pieces together and recalling certain design aspects and techniques I learned previously.</p>

				
				<p>I wanted to give my website a minimalistic look. I feel that overcrowding and excess design tends to bog down websites and I wanted to avoid that so that
				my website was easy to navigate and placed its focus on the content. This is what it looks like at the time of writing, but I want to learn more and do more
				and see what else I can make out of it.</p>
				
				<p>Lastly, I wanted to blog about the codenames. Mostly, I don't want to have to rewrite "Alien Entrepreneurs from the Wild Wild West" or "Inspirational New
				Tab Page" on every single blog post, so I thought it would be fun to give these projects names. The website gets the name "SPIDER" because of the keyword "web".
				Puns are lots of fun!</p>

				<h3> Jan 07 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: INSPIRE</p>

				<p>Today I'm showcasing my newest learning experience in developing an extension for Google Chrome, an endeavor I always wanted to do.
				I decided to start it off simple with a New Tab Page to replace the default page that I never use. This replacement will display an inspiring quote
				to the user.</p>

				
				<p>I was a little shocked and excited to find out that it's pretty much just simple HTML to create this page. What's interesting is how to move forward. 
				I want to integrate the twitter API into this extension in order to randomly pull up inspiring tweets. Being unfamiliar with the twitter API, this seems
				quite daunting, but I'm also excited to learn from this!</p>

				<h3> Jan 06 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: LIFELINE</p>

				<p>First blog post! This one is about my game, Alien Entrepreneurs from the Wild Wild West. 
				This is a co-op puzzle game in which players control 4 aliens who have recently crash-landed in the Wild West. 
				They must work together to collect eggplants and turn them into hats which they can sell to pay for their ship to be rebuilt.</p>

				
				<p>Players must work together and avoid obstacles to reach the eggplant in each level. This picture showcases the game with basic art added during the past few days. 
				Over the next few days, I will show off different features to the game and levels, as well as outline the development process, the difficulties I run into, 
				and the solutions I put together.</p>
