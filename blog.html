				<p>Codename: NPC</p>

				<p>I was able to finish my DND NPC Generator today!</p>
				
				<p>This project, while relatively simple, was lots of fun. I was able to create something useful and learn how to use javascript to create a webapp.
				I hope to use the knowledge gained from this project to continue learning more about web development and improving my abilities.</p>

				<h3> Jan 14 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: VXA</p>

				<p>Today is another rewind blog: my intro to coding. As a kid in around 2011 and 2012, I was very interested in a program named RPG Maker. Namely, the versions
				VX and VXAce. I became so interested that I wanted to make my own scripts for this engine so that I could add features that I find interesting.</p>
				
				<p>Using online forums, tutorials, and a lot of trial and error, I learned to make many different scripts that allowed me to make games the way I wanted to. I learned
				RGSS3, a form of ruby, and posted my code online for others to use in their games. I was able to learn that basics of coding and development, and the interest quickly
				grew overtime. My original codes helped me learn the basics and allowed for me to carry over interesting RPG ideas into my other projects.</p>

				<h3> Jan 13 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: LEGO</p>

				<p>Throughout my later years of high school, I joined my school's robotics team. We were a team of three guys who had an interest in computers and took the school's
				computer engineering course. As a team of three, we were tasked with designing, building, programming, and testing robots to compete in various competions, as well
				as help run other competitions for elementary schools.</p>
				
				<p>We used python to get these robots moving, and through rigorous testing we continued to improve our robots. We competed in UOIT's Sumobot competition in both years.
				We were new to the concept in 2015 and only did decently, but in 2016 we used what we learned and made an even better robot. We were close to making the semifinals, and while
				we didn't win, we learned a lot and had lots of fun with it!</p>

				<h3> Jan 11 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: NPC</p>

				<p>Last night, a friend helped me come up with an idea for a simple webapp that would allow to me to learn javascript. I want to learn javascript
				in order to provide more functionality to expand on my website and for chrome extensions.</p>

				
				<p>This project is relatively simple. It generates a random non-player character that can be used for a Dungeons and Dragons game. I plan to add
				saving/exporting functionality once the rest of it settles in.</p>

				<h3> Jan 10 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: KITCHEN</p>

				<p>Today, I wanted to share about another project of mine. This one is called "CookIt", a game made for my High School Computer Engineering class.</p>

				<p>This is an endless game where two players have to endlessly cook burgers by working together. Each player has access to a certain set of tools
				and must pass along ingredients for the other to use.</p>
				
				<p>This project was made in Python using the Pygame module. It was developed to be played on a Raspberry Pi using the EveOne board. I'll be blogging about
				this interfacing on a later date!</p>
