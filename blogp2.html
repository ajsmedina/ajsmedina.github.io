				<h3> Jan 07 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: INSPIRE</p>

				<p>Today I'm showcasing my newest learning experience in developing an extension for Google Chrome, an endeavor I always wanted to do.
				I decided to start it off simple with a New Tab Page to replace the default page that I never use. This replacement will display an inspiring quote
				to the user.</p>

				
				<p>I was a little shocked and excited to find out that it's pretty much just simple HTML to create this page. What's interesting is how to move forward. 
				I want to integrate the twitter API into this extension in order to randomly pull up inspiring tweets. Being unfamiliar with the twitter API, this seems
				quite daunting, but I'm also excited to learn from this!</p>

				<h3> Jan 06 2018 </h3>
				<p>Codename: LIFELINE</p>

				<p>First blog post! This one is about my game, Alien Entrepreneurs from the Wild Wild West. 
				This is a co-op puzzle game in which players control 4 aliens who have recently crash-landed in the Wild West. 
				They must work together to collect eggplants and turn them into hats which they can sell to pay for their ship to be rebuilt.</p>

				
				<p>Players must work together and avoid obstacles to reach the eggplant in each level. This picture showcases the game with basic art added during the past few days. 
				Over the next few days, I will show off different features to the game and levels, as well as outline the development process, the difficulties I run into, 
				and the solutions I put together.</p>
